-- Clue #1: We recently got word that someone fitting Carmen Sandiego's description has been

-- so find the least populated country in Southern Europe, and we'll start looking for her there.

SELECT * 
FROM country 
WHERE population = (SELECT MIN(population) FROM country WHERE region = 'Southern Europe');
